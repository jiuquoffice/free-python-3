Free Python Games
=================

`Free Python Games`_ is an Apache2 licensed collection of free Python games
intended for education and fun.

// fun to play
// easy to tinker
// Python is an excellent language for learners
// built atop Turtle, award winning library for learners?
// work on Raspberry Pi

A collection (18) of free python games.

In the first half of 2012, I wrote ten games to teach a group of students some
basics of programming. The goal was to have fun as much as it was to
learn. Here you'll find simplified versions of several classics.

In 2013, I used these games again as part of a programming club for high school
students at Downtown College Prep in San Jose, CA. At that time, I added a
number of new games bringing the total up to eighteen and covering more
advanced topics like projectile motion and encryption.

In 2014, I used these games as part of week-long programming club that met in
the evenings at The River Church Community in San Jose, CA. Our demographic was
middle and high school students.

In 2017, I taught a week-long summer camp using these games running on Raspberry Pis.

Each game is entirely independent from the others and includes comments along
with a list of exercises to work through with students. Creativity and
flexibility is important. There's no right or wrong way to implement a new
feature! You never know which games the students will find really interesting.
